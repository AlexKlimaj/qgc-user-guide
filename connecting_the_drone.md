# Connecting the drone
In most cases if you have connected to your vehicle directly via USB, through a telemetry radio or over WiFi you should not need to take any additional steps. **QGroundControl** should detect your vehicle and **connect it automatically**.

Here is how **QGroundControl** looks like when your vehicle is connected. 









In this view there are little green and/or red indicators dots. A green indicator shows that setup for that area is
complete, whereas a red indicator shows it is incomplete. You should not fly if any of the indicators are red.
If there is no indicator dot at all for the area that means that additional setup for this area is optional.
