# Connecting the drone
In most cases if you have connected to your vehicle directly via USB, through a telemetry radio or over WiFi you should not need to take any additional steps. QGroundControl should detect your vehicle and connect it automatically.

By default QGroundControl will show you the Fly view as shown here. If your vehicle requires additional setup you will be automatically shown the Setup view instead.
