### Android daily builds

Daily builds for Android now have there own Google Play store entry. The old opt-in beta test is no longer valid. If you were a member of that you should [opt-out](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.mavlink.qgroundcontrol).


### Installing iOS Beta using Test Flight

The iOS version of QGroundControl is currently in open Beta. You can opt-in to the Beta by adding your email address [here](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/3509). Keep in mind that due to device restrictions on iOS only WiFi connections are supported. Once installed you will be notified of new versions through the Test Flight app. The release frequency of iOS beta builds is on an ad-hoc basis more on the order of a new build every week or two.
