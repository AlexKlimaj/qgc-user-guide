# Plan View

![](PlanView.jpg)

The Plan View is used to plan autonomous missions for you Vehicle. Once the mission is planned and sent to the vehicle, you switch to the [Fly View](FlyView.md) to fly the mission.

If your Vehicle supports a GeoFence you can also set that up from the Plan View.

The image above shows a simple mission which starts with a takeoff, flies through two waypoints and then lands.
